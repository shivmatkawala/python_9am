******************************************************Tuple Data Type in Python*************************************************************************


In Python, a tuple is an immutable data structure used to store an ordered sequence of elements. 

Once created, the elements within a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed. 

This immutability makes tuples useful for representing fixed collections of items.


KEY CHARECTERISTICS OF TUPLE:-

	Immutable: Tuples cannot be modified after creation.

	Ordered: Elements have a fixed order.

	Heterogeneous: Elements can be of different data types.

	Indexed: Each element in a tuple is associated with an index starting from 0.


CREATING TUPLE:-

	Tuples are created using parentheses () or the tuple() function.

	Example: tuple1 = (1, 2, 'Rajesh', 'Sunaina')

		 tuple2 = tuple([67, True, 'King'])  ----> Accepts an iterable as an argument

		 tuple3 = (5,)


ACCESSING TUPLE:-
	Elements in a tuple are accessed by their index, similar to lists.

	print(tuple1[1])



IN BUILT METHODS:-
	Since tuples are immutable, they have fewer methods compared to lists.

	tuple1.count(1) ----> Returns the count of 2 in tupple.

	tuple1.index(3) ----> Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item. 
				Optionally, you can provide start and end indices to limit the search range.


ADDITIONAL METHODS OF TUPLE:-

	Concatenation:-

		tuple1 = (1, 2)
		tuple2 = (3, 4)
		result = tuple1 + tuple2 


	Repetition:-
		tuple1 = (1, 2) * 3 


	Unpacking:-
		
		tuple1 = (1, "apple", 3.5)

		a, b, c = tuple1


	Slicing:-
