***********************************Singned Byte VS Unsigned Byte*****************************************

The difference between signed and unsigned bytes lies in how the range of values for the byte is represented and interpreted. A byte is an 8-bit data unit, but the choice of signed or unsigned determines whether the most significant bit (MSB) is treated as a sign bit or as part of the numeric value.


Signed Byte
	A signed byte uses the most significant bit (MSB) as a sign indicator.
	If the MSB is 0, the number is positive or zero.
	If the MSB is 1, the number is negative.
	Signed bytes use two's complement to represent negative numbers.
	Range of Signed Byte
	An 8-bit signed byte can represent values from -128 to +127.

	This is because:
		00000000 = 0
		01111111 = +127
		10000000 = -128 (in two's complement)
		11111111 = -1 (in two's complement)

	Use Case
	     Signed bytes are used when both positive and negative numbers need to be represented, such as in temperature readings or offsets.



Unsigned Byte
	An unsigned byte treats all 8 bits as part of the numeric value.
	There is no sign bit.
	All possible values are non-negative.
	Range of Unsigned Byte
	An 8-bit unsigned byte can represent values from 0 to 255.

	This is because:
		00000000 = 0
		11111111 = 255

	Use Case
		Unsigned bytes are used when only non-negative numbers are needed, such as in image processing (where pixel values range from 0 		to 255) or for raw binary data.
