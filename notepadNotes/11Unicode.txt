****************************************************Unicode*****************************************************

For every language there are different codes and those codes combined are called as unicode.

• It can be termed as unique code or universal code.

• For representing UTF(Unicode Transformation Format) is followed called as UTF-8 or UTF-16

and UTF-32. This type of formats are followed.

• UTF-8 means allows 1 byte also 2,4
• UTF-32-4 bytes
• Where to nd unicode
• Unicode.org—>code—>select any.

How to use Unicode

s='\u03b1'
print(s)
'α'

s='\u03b1\u0B32\u03B3'
print(s)
‘αβγ’

Every code represents unique alphabet. Each of these is called code byte.
 For any language we can visit 'unicode.org' website and choose codes

s='\u0915\u0916\u0917'
print(s)
'कखग'

s='u0041'
print(s)
'u0041'

s='\u0041'
print(s)
'A'

s='\x41'
print(s)
'A'

why unicodes ?

	 The unicodes are used as exactly same as ascii codes.
	 but ascii codes range is small [0-256]
	 ascii codes only represent english charecters
	 so, to represent all international languages charecters we needed a very wide range codes range, so  	 	developers developed unicode concept.
	
	ascii codes are decinmal numbers, but unicodes are hexadecimal numbers.
	
	As i told all engliush charecters are having ascii codes in ascii system, the same way english and other all languages also have unicodes too.


what is hexadecimal number system and why we need i?
	The hexadecimal number system (also called base-16) is a positional numeral system that uses 16 unique 	symbols to represent values:
	
	digits are same as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
	letters are A, B, C, D, E, F which represent decimal values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

	Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16 starting with 16 ** 0at the rightmost 	position.
	
	example:
		Hexadecimal 1A3:  [1 * (16 ** 2)] +[ A * (16 ** 1)] + [3 * (16 ** 0)] = 256 + 160 + 3 = 419 (419 		is decimal representation)

	python functions to convert hexadecimal number to decimal number:
			x = int('1A3', 16)
			print(x)

	puthon function to convert decimal number to hexadecimal number:
			y = hex(419)
			print(y)

	The hexadecimal system simplifies working with binary data in computing. It is compact, easy to convert 	to/from binary, and widely adopted in various technological fields like programming, networking, and web 	development.


what is the range of unicode ?

	The range of Unicode code points is from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, covering a total of 1,114,112 code points.
