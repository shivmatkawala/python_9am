*****************************************************Range Data Type in Python**************************************************************

The range data type in Python represents an immutable sequence of numbers, typically used for looping a specific number of times in for loops. 

It generates numbers in a specified range without storing them in memory, which makes it highly efficient.



CREATE A RANGE OBJECT:-

	The range function can be called with one, two, or three arguments:

		range(stop) Generates numbers from 0 up to stop, but not including, stop.

		range(start, stop): Generates numbers from start up to stop, but not including, stop.

		range(start, stop, step): Generates numbers from start up to stop, but not including, stop, incrementing by step.

	Examples:
		
		range1 = range(5)           # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

		range2 = range(2, 6)        # 2, 3, 4, 5

		range3 = range(1, 10, 2)    # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9


CHARECTERISTICS OF RANGE:-

	Immutable: 
		Once created, the sequence cannot be modified.

	Memory Efficient: 
		Unlike lists, range objects do not store each number in memory. Instead, they generate each number on demand.

	Lazy Evaluation: 
		The values are produced as needed, making range ideal for generating large sequences without consuming large amounts of memory.



ACCESSING ELEMENTS IN A RANGE:-
	You can access elements in a range object by indexing or iterating over it.

		r = range(1, 10, 2)

		print(r[1])     # Output: 3 (second element in the range)

		print(list(r))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]



BUIL IN METHODS OF RANGE:-
	
	r = range(1, 10, 2)

	print(len(r)) --->Returns the length (number of elements) of the range sequence.
	
	print(max(r)) ,   print(min(r))  ---> Returns the smallest, largest element in the range.

	print(r.index(5)) ---> Returns the index of the specified item in the range. Raises a ValueError if the item is not in the range.

	print(r.count(3))  ----> Returns the number of occurrences of the specified item in the range (0 or 1 since each number is unique in range).


	
CONVERSION OF RANGE TO OTHER DATA TYPES:-

	r = range(5)

	Convert to a list
	print(list(r))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

	Convert to a tuple
	print(tuple(r))  # Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

	Convert to a set
	print(set(r))    # Output: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
